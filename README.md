# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

The **Iris Flower Classification** project is a classic machine learning example that demonstrates supervised classification using the well-known **Iris dataset**. The goal is to classify iris flowers into three species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* — based on measurements of their sepals and petals.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project trains a machine learning model to accurately classify Iris flower species based on:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

It serves as a great beginner-level project for understanding:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation

## 📊 Dataset

The Iris dataset is built into `scikit-learn` and consists of:
- 150 samples
- 4 features
- 3 classes (species)
